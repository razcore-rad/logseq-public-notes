			- Tonic (**T**) is **stable**.
			- Subdominant (**S**) is **semi-unstable**. *Resolve to the tonic or dominant*.
			- Dominant (**D**) is **very unstable**. *Resolve to the tonic*.
	- ## Constructing Chords
		- For major and minor families of scales, made up of 7-note, we can use the **add-skip** method to construct 3-note chords called **triads**. For example if we take the C #major-scale we can the basic **triad** chords starting on each of the notes.

	- ## Writing Chord Progressions
		- **stable - unstable** pattern until you end with a cadence.
		- **T-S-D-T** pattern until you end with a cadence.
	- ## Voice Leading
		- ### Guide
			- Start by doubling the root of each chord an octave below to create your bass line.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Then rearrange the original notes of your chords to eliminate as much movement as possible, while avoiding parallel 5ths or octaves.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Try to make sure you're using contrary/oblique motion between the top and bottom lines of your progression as often as possible.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ### Tips
			- 4th or 5th apart: keep the common tone in one voice, and move the other two by step.
			- 3rd or 6th apart: keep the common tones in the same voices, and move the remaining pitch by step.
			- 2nd or 7th apart: move one note by 3rd and the other two by step.
	- ## Exercises
		- **Writing major scales.** Pick five notes on the piano and build the #major-scale from each of them.

		- **Writing chord progressions.** Find the diatonic chords of every major scale you created. Use the **stable - unstable** or **T-S-D-T** pattern to create a chord progression in each of the five **major** keys.
