		- Main
		  collapsed:: true
			- 180ml warm water
			- 1tsp active yeast (if using fast acting, cut rise time in half)
			- 1tsp organic cane sugar
			- 272g unbleached all-purpose flour (sub up to 1/2 with spelt or see notes* for whole-grain blend)
			- 1tsp fine sea salt
			- 3/4tsp baking powder
			- 9g garlic, minced *optional*
			- ~42g plain dairy-free yogurt (coconut is best – I like COYO brand best or So Delicious)
			- 30ml olive or avocado oil
		- Serving
		  collapsed:: true
			- 28g vegan butter or coconut oil (melted)
			- 9g minced garlic
			- sea salt
			- fresh cilantro or parsley
	- Instructions
		- Measure out warm water (3/4 cup as original recipe is written // ~110˚F or 43˚C to properly activate yeast) and add yeast and sugar. Stir and set aside until frothy and foamy – about 10 minutes.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- In the meantime, add flour(s), salt, and baking powder to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Once the yeast mixture is foaming, add the vegan yogurt and oil* and stir to combine. Add to dry ingredients and use a fork to mix - the dough will be sticky.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Turn onto a floured surface and add just enough flour to gently knead for 5 turns and form into a loose ball. Place back in mixing bowl and rub with a bit more oil and turn to coat. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place for at least 2 hours (up to 4 hours). (I like setting it in a sunny spot in the kitchen or in the laundry room.)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Remove dough from bowl and turn onto a floured surface. Knead for 30 seconds (adding additional flour if sticky). Then divide into 6 even pieces with hands or a knife.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Lightly knead each ball until it forms a loose ball (15 seconds) and set on a clean surface. Repeat until all dough is formed into balls. Then cover with plastic wrap again and let rest for 10 minutes.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- In the meantime, prepare any garnishes for topping (i.e. melted vegan butter or coconut oil, sea salt, minced garlic, or cilantro).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Once the dough has rested, begin heating a cast-iron pan (not non-stick) over medium heat. Take a piece of dough and lay it on a floured surface. Then roll out into an oval or circle with a rolling pin. Carefully flip over and pat the dough with a bit of water so it doesn’t stick to the pan. At this time, press the garlic and cilantro onto one side so it sticks. Then place the wet-side down on the hot pan.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Cook for 1 minute or until the edges of the dough look dry and it’s beginning to bubble. Then flip the dough with a spatula and cook until the underside is dark brown. If using a gas range, you can put the naan directly over the flame when cooking the second side, but be careful, as it goes fast and the naan can burn much more easily.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Repeat until all naan is cooked. Then brush with melted vegan butter or coconut oil and sprinkle with cilantro, garlic, and sea salt (optional). Serve immediately.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Cover leftovers and store at room temperature for about 2 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Notes
		- Alternative Whole Grain Flour Blend (use in place of all purpose): 1 cup + 1 Tbsp (127.5 g) unbleached all purpose flour, 1/2 cup (60 g) spelt flour, 1/3 cup (40 g) oat flour, 2 Tbsp (6 g) cornstarch (or arrowroot starch)
		- Looking for a gluten-free version? Check out our Fluffy Gluten-Free Naan (Yeast-Free, 20 Minutes!)
		- If omitting oil, sub additional vegan yogurt. I haven’t tested it this way but think this would be the best way to keep it oil-free.

		- Main
		  collapsed:: true
			- 350g Extra Firm Tofu - cut into 1 inch X 1 inch cubes
			- 1 Tablespoon Corn Starch
			- 3 tablespoon Cooking Oil (I have used LIGHT olive oil which has a high smoking point)
			- 1/4 Teaspoon Salt OR to taste (I have added pink Himalayan salt)
			- 130g / 1 Cup Onion - Sliced 1/8 inch thick
			- 300g / 5 Cups Broccoli - cut into florets
			- 1+1/2 Tablespoon Garlic - 4 Garlic cloves finely chopped
			- 1 Tablespoon Ginger - 1 inch Ginger finely chopped
			- 1/2 Teaspoon Chili Flakes or to taste
			- 1/3 Cup / 25g Green onion
			- 2 Teaspoons Sesame Oil
		- Sauce
		  collapsed:: true
			- 1 Cup Vegetable Broth (LOW SODIUM)
			- 1+1/2 Tablespoon Soy Sauce or Tamari
			- 2 Tablespoon DARK Soy Sauce (This is a key ingredient. It adds a depth of flavor and richness to this dish, so I DO NOT recommend substituting it)
			- 1 Tablespoon White Vinegar (I have added white wine vinegar)
			- 1+1/2 Tablespoon Maple Syrup
			- 1/4 Teaspoon Black Pepper
			- 1+1/2 Tablespoon Corn Starch
	- Instructions
	  collapsed:: true
		- Drain the tofu and cut it into 1 inch X 1 inch cubes and add corn starch. Mix well to coat the tofu with corn starch.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- To a small bowl add the LOW SODIUM vegetable broth, soy sauce, DARK soy sauce, white vinegar, maple syrup, ground black pepper and corn starch. Mix it well and set it aside for later.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- To a heated pan add the oil, tofu (coated with corn starch) and salt. Fry on medium-high heat for only 30 seconds and then right a way reduce the heat to medium low and then add the finely chopped garlic, ginger and chili flakes. Mix well and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on medium-low heat. Add the onion and broccoli and turn the heat to medium-high or high (depending the heat of your stove) and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes until the onion is soft and the broccoli is slightly cooked.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Add the sauce. Make sure to stir the sauce well before adding it that’s because the corn starch has a tendency to collect at the bottom of the bowl.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Notes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Every stove is different so regulate the heat as required. If at any point you notice the pan is getting over heated, then reduce the heat.
		- FRY THE TOFU FOR ONLY 30 SECONDS AT FIRST NO LONGER THAN THAT and then fry it further along with the ginger, garlic and chili flakes for another 2 to 3 minutes. This will prevent the tofu from getting too chewy. We don't want to over cook the tofu because we'll fry it further with the onion and broccoli.
		- I have used LOW SODIUM VEGETABLE BROTH (for the sauce) which has barely any salt in it. If you are using the regular type adjust the salt accordingly
		- DARK Soy Sauce is a key ingredient here. It adds a depth of flavor and richness to this dish. I DO NOT recommend substituting it
		- Make sure to stir the sauce well before adding it to the pan to incorporate the corn starch because corn starch has a tendency to collect at the bottom of the bowl
		- Cook the sauce to your desired consistency

	- Instructions
	  collapsed:: true
		- To a heated pot add the olive oil, onion, salt and fry on medium heat until the onion starts to brown. Add the cooked chickpeas, and water and bring to a rapid simmer, then cover the lid and cook for 10 minutes on medium-low heat. Uncover and add spinach and mix well and you will notice that the spinach starts to wilt.  Turn off the heat right away and let it cool down completely.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Once cooled transfer the chickpea spinach mix to the food processor/blender along with the avocado, lemon juice, tahini, ground cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt and blend it to a fine puree. Make sure to scrape the sides of the container and give it a mix in between so it blends well, it will take about 5 to 6 minutes (depending on your food processor). The end product should be smooth and airy, so take your time to blend it.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Transfer it into a container and let it set in the fridge for about 2 to 3 hours and serve with your favorite topping. I like to top it with some finely chopped jalapeno and a good quality olive oil.

	  collapsed:: true
		- Thoroughly wash the rice a few times until the water runs clear. This will get rid of any impurities/gunk and will give a much better/clean taste.
		- Then soak the rice in water for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes drain the water from the rice and leave it to sit in the strainer to drain any excess water, until ready to use.
		- Transfer the raw cashews to a pan and dry roast it on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Once roasted remove the cashews from the pan and set it aside for later use.
		- To the same pan add olive oil, bay leaves, onion, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and fry on medium heat until the onion is just starts to brown. It takes about 5 to 6 minutes.
		- Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic, green chilies and fry on medium heat for about 1 to 2 minutes or until fragrant. Then reduce the heat to low to prevent the spices from burning. Add the turmeric and garam masala. Fry for 30 seconds to a minute.
		- Add the soaked/strained rice, salt, water and mix well. Increase the heat to high and bring it to a vigorous boil.
		- Once the water starts to boil, then cover the lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook on low heat for about 10 minutes or until the rice is cooked.
		- Once the rice is cooked, uncover the lid and turn off the heat. Add chopped raisins, and roasted cashews and mix it.
	- Notes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Thoroughly wash the rice until water runs clear, this will get rid of any impurities/gunk and will give a much better/clean taste.
		- Use a Wider Cooking Pan to make this dish. This will cook the rice evenly and prevent it from getting mushy.
		- Adding salt to onion will release it's moisture and will help it cook/caramelize faster, so please don’t skip this step.
		- After adding the cashews and raisins to the cooked rice mix the rice very carefully and gently to prevent the rice grains from breaking. Do not over mix at this time because the rice grains are very soft and can turn into mush.

		- Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork. Then set it aside for it to cool down.
		- Now heat a pan and add 3 tablespoons of cooking oil and let it heat thoroughly. Once the oil is heated, reduce the stove heat to low and then add the mustard seed
		- When the mustard seeds start to crackle, then add the cumin and curry leaves and give it a stir and fry it for a few seconds.
		- Now add the chopped onion, carrot, bell pepper, salt and turn the heat to medium. Fry until the onion starts to caramelized. Then add the finely chopped ginger, turmeric, cayenne pepper and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes to get rid of the raw flavour of the turmeric.

		- If you add the mustard and cumin seeds together, the cumin will burn before even the mustard seed crackles do be careful there.
		- This recipe is for white basmati rice, if you are using a different kind of rice adjust the water accordingly.
		- Cook the basmati rice in a wider pan, this will prevent the rice from getting soggy.
		- You could use leftover cooked rice for this recipe.
		- Reducing the heat to low before adding the seeds will prevent the seeds from burning.

	- Notes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Adding salt to onion will release it's moisture and will help it cook/caramelize faster, so please don’t skip this step
		- Fry the onion until it's nicely caramelized, this will add a lot of flavour to the dish
		- Reduce the heat before adding the spices, this will prevent it from burning - burnt spices will make the dish bitter
		- The garnish is what completes the dish so please do not skip any of the ingredients
		- Every stove is different, so if needed adjust the cooking time and the heat of your stove accordingly

	- Notes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Every stove is different, so if needed adjust the cooking time and the heat of your stove accordingly
		- Fry the onion until it’s slightly caramelized, this will add a lot of flavour to the stew
		- If potatoes you are using are tender then it will cook faster in about 20 to 25 minutes, however if the potatoes you are using are tough and old the it will take longer to cook for about 30 to 35 minutes, so use your judgement with the cooking time
		- If incase the stew gets too thick, add boiling water or broth to thin it out. DO NOT add cold water, it will ruin the taste
